This project was an exploratory effort to convert my hooks-library repo to Typescript.

Dependencies:
Node 10.16
npm 6.10.1
React 16.8
Typescript 3.5.3

To install this project locally:

1. Clone the repo into a folder.
2. cd into the folder.
3. Run "npm install; npm start"
4. Navigate in your browser to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.

Please note that only deleting items has been implemented to test the reducer. Other actions (adding, modifying) do not work.
